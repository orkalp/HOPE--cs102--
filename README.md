Our android app basically lets users create profiles, edit them, and most importantly contact charity organisations

Charity information, users' actions such as click counts and time spent in-app, as well as profile info, are kept locally on the app directory on the physical device. 

Initially we thought of implementing an actual payment system for donations but as PayPal's SDK was a pain in the neck and we didn't have much time left, we ended up with opening up donation and home pages of the desired charity in-app.

In this repo, one can find the core java snippets of our app. Due to my infamous archiving skills, I wasn't able to upload the code directed to UI.
